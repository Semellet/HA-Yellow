Step 1: Install the RaspberryPi onto the mainboard as shown (be careful with the pins under the board):

Step 2: Take the Heatsink and put the spring clips through the screw holes in the Heatsink.

Step 3: Find the thermal pads and peel off the plastic before putting them over the CPU and Memory chips:

Step 4: Put the Heatsink on the Pi and push the screws through the holes until they snap into place (hold it tight, but dont crush it for 30-60 seconds so the pads stick to the Heatsink well)
