<h2>Putting the bits together</h2>

Step 1: Install the RaspberryPi onto the mainboard as shown (be careful with the pins under the board):

Step 2: Take the Heatsink and put the spring clips through the screw holes in the Heatsink.

Step 3: Find the thermal pads and peel off the plastic before putting them over the CPU and Memory chips:

Step 4: Put the Heatsink on the Pi and push the screws through the holes until they snap into place (hold it tight, but dont crush it for 30-60 seconds so the pads stick to the Heatsink well)

<i>NOTE:</i> Your Compute Module 5 comes with enough storage to install Home Assistant without an SSD, so you can use the SSD as extra storage for Security Camera video etc.

Step 5: Install the SSD in the SSD slot - if you have bought a shorter version - you might need to move the screw on the back to another hole, but it should fit in one of the holes shown - it goes here:

The board is no ready for [Installing Home Assistant](https://github.com/Semellet/HA-Yellow/blob/main/2.%20Installing_Home_Assistant.md).
